#H1 Release

#H2 About
Release is a website that hopes to introduce users to two powerful self-improvement techniques; meditation and yoga. The target users for this site will be beginners looking for information about what the benefits of meditation and yoga are, how they can perform these practices at home and prepare them for what equipment they might need. 

Release will also provide a great starting point for those that wish to go on and adopt meditation and/or yoga by providing them with useful links and materials that can be accessed by users in their own local areas. Users will also have the option of contacting a member of the Release team, or recieving monthly self-improvement and mindfulness tips through the monthly newsletter.
