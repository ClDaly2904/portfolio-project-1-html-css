# Release

##  About
Release is a website that hopes to introduce users to two powerful self-improvement techniques; meditation and yoga. The target users for this site will be beginners looking for information about what the benefits of meditation and yoga are, how they can perform these practices at home and prepare them for what equipment they might need. 

Release will also provide a great starting point for those that wish to go on and adopt meditation and/or yoga by providing them with useful links and materials that can be accessed by users in their own local areas. Users will also have the option of contacting a member of the Release team, or recieving monthly self-improvement and mindfulness tips through the monthly newsletter.

## Features

- Nav bar - the navigation bar is a consistent feature across all pages of the site. It includes links to the Home Page, Meditation page, Yoga page and the Signup page. It is located at the top of each page and is 'sticky' so that the user can intuitively locate and use to easily navigate between pages across all devices no matter how far down their current page they are.
- Footer - the footer is also a feature on all pages, allowing the user to access Release's Facebook, Twitter and Instagram social media platforms. It also contains an email address for Release, providing an alternate route for users to access contact information without having to navigate to a different page, along with providing copyright information.

- Home page
    - Landing page image- the large hero image serves to grab the user's attention and to set the tone of the site. It demonstrates the type of tranquility and peacefulness that can be found when practicing meditation and yoga and inspires the user to attain the same.
    - Connect section - this section serves to pique the user's curiosity, introduce the user to the two self-improvement techniques focused on in the site and highlight what information they can expect to find in the relevant pages.
    - Newsletter and fig section - this section compliments the rest of the homepage by including a **professional figure TBC** to reassure users that the site is a reliable source of information and there are real proven benefits to the self-improvement menthods included. The image demonstrates the state of mindfulness the user may be hoping to achieve. This section also promotes Release's monthly newsletter and what they can expect from it.

- Future features
    - Would like to add inspirational quotes layered over existing layout

## Testing

[//]: #fixed bugs
bugs to fix- header content overflowing header element, getting cut off the page- used git to compare to earlier versions of CSS code. Found the difference in css under .header. The insertion of width 100% here had made the header expand.
div: hover was only effecting the span and h3 inside it, not the div itself. Nested whole div inside the anchor element.
