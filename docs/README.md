# Release

##  About

Release is a website that hopes to introduce users to two powerful self-improvement techniques; meditation and yoga.

The target users for this site will be novices searching for inspiration and reliable information about how they can improve themselves (both body and mind). These users will likely be unfamiliar with meditation and/or yoga so the site will cover all the basics for them. Release will act as a guide to what the benefits of meditation and yoga are, how they can perform these practices at home and prepare them for what equipment they might need. 

Release will also provide a great starting point for those that wish to go on and adopt meditation and/or yoga by providing them with useful links and materials that can be accessed by users in their own local areas. Users will also have the option of contacting a member of the Release team, or recieving monthly self-improvement and mindfulness tips through the monthly newsletter.

### Target audiences
- Users searching to connect their bodies and minds
- Users looking to promote self-improvement who have not heard of the specific methods of meditation and yoga
- Users who have heard about meditation and/or yoga and wish to know more about how it can help them and how they can do it
- Users who have some familiarity with the practices and are looking to connect with more resources, such as equipment or how to find a group to join
- Although a large bulk of visitors will be first-time visitors using Release as a base, returning visitors can benefit from the demonstration resources or equipment links to strengthen their existing practice

### User Stories

As a user, I am looking to improve myself and my mental wellbeing. I am looking for a reliable site that can teach me how I can do this.

I need to come away from the site with a clear understanding of one or more different methods I can do in order to connect to my body and mind and become a better me. I will need to know what things I can do, and what benefits I can expect when using them. As a beginner I will also need materials to help me learn how to do them, such as instructions and demonstrations. I also need to know what, if any, equipment I may use to carry them out.

I may also require additional support. I would like the opportunity to reach out if there is something I do not quite understand or if all my questions haven't been answered, or if there are any communities I can join to help me with this journey. I would also like the option to sign-up to recieve further information, and specify this request to the area that I am most interested in.

To be able to do all this I will need a site that is clear in its purpose and can be easily navigated. I want to be able to find specific topics easily and be able to navigate them at all times without causing frustration. I will deem my visit to the site successful if I can come away from it feeling like I have gained valuable information and a solid starting point on my journey to self-improvement.

## Features

- ### Nav bar 
    - the navigation bar is a consistent feature across all pages of the site. It includes links to the Home Page, Meditation page, Yoga page and the Signup page. It is located at the top of each page and is 'sticky' so that the user can intuitively locate and use to easily navigate between pages across all devices no matter how far down their current page they are.
- ### Hero Images
    - the large hero images serves to grab the user's attention and to set the tone of the site. It demonstrates the type of tranquility and peacefulness that can be found when practicing meditation and yoga and inspires the user to attain the same.
- ### Footer 
    - the footer is also a feature on all pages, allowing the user to access Release's Facebook, Twitter and Instagram social media platforms. It also contains an email address for Release, providing an alternate route for users to access contact information without having to navigate to a different page, along with providing copyright information.

- ### Home page
    - Connect section - this section serves to pique the user's curiosity, introduce the user to the two self-improvement techniques focused on in the site and highlight what information they can expect to find in the relevant pages.
    - Newsletter and fig section - this section compliments the rest of the homepage by including a data graph to reassure users that the site is a reliable source of information and there are real proven benefits to the self-improvement menthods included. The image demonstrates the state of mindfulness the user may be hoping to achieve. This section also promotes Release's monthly newsletter and what they can expect from it.

- ### Meditation and Yoga pages
    - Intro section - gives the user an understanding of what each method entails and how it can be beneficial to them. This is presented first on the page as they are more likely to carry on reading once they have seen the positive effects both meditation and yoga give.
    - How to section - gives the user a basic understanding how to undertake the practice and provides resources for further information. The image gives a visual demonstration and the video provides a more immersive experience for the user.
    - Equipment section - allows the user to see what equipment they might need. Links to buy equipment which may make the user excited to have a go at one or both of the practices. Also provides 'at home' alternatives for those who want to try meditation or yoga out before investing. Also has a call to action button to entice the user to find a meditation/yoga group near them, as many people like the social aspect of exercise or are more committed when part of a group.

- ### Contact and Sign-up page
    - Contains varied contact information for Release for users seeking more help or information.
    - The sign-up form not only allows the user to sign up to the monthly newsletter but lets them set preferences for what kind of information they would like to recieve (meditation, yoga or general mindfulness tips), in turn giving feedback to Release to see what area is the most popular. The user will also be asked to submit their full name and email address.

- ### Future features
    - Would like to add inspirational quotes layered over existing layout to inspire users
    - Would like to add carousel made up of yoga poses to give users more inspiration, and encourage users to return to the site
    - Would like to add a 30-Day Meditation and (or) Yoga tracker/ challenge to enagage users and help them track their progress, as it can take some time for habits to form. People who have committed to something for 30 days are more likely to continue it.
